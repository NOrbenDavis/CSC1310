# Travel Agent Program
The purpose of this program is to receive a list of Destinations given by a file. These destinations are dynamically allocated and then sorted alphabetically into a linked list. The questionnaire is red herring and does nothing besides validate input. 'Based' on your answers you are given a random destination to travel to.
###Built with
